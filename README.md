# Budget2
This is a budgeting app that I designed. It is an upgraded version of an older app... I built off of the old design and added more functionality and features.

In order to use Budget2, load the src file, and run the Window.java file.

This app is designed to help estimate and project expenses into the future. There is also a built in savings compound interest calculator.
There are still bugs and features that need to be implemented, and I will continue to work on them in the future.
